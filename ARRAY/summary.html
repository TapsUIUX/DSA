        If it aks for indexes for 2 elemetts whols sum is present in the array
        You know that
        <span class="red b">this then USE A map to store the values</span> and
        then comare the TARGET - current value with the stored values.
      </li>
      <li>
        In case of it asked for 3 sum values ,<span class="red b"
          >SORT the array and then use 3 pointer</span
        >
        at i , i+1 and at end , and based on SUM is greated than the TARGET or
        Less thatn the Target Move the poiiners
      </li>
      <li>
        if there is a Tergaet and it askes for if the TARGET sum exists or the
        diference exist, How many sum exists then it is a
        <span class="red b">Knap Shack</span> Problem
      </li>
      <li>
        if it is water problem , at a postion then see Min of max left max right
        , then
        <span class="red b"
          >find 2 array all maxx left and all max right and min of values
          at</span
        >
        index will solve the issues, if it as a area between ideces,
        <span class="red b">the uses 2 pointer and keep track Max,</span> and
        based on max move the left and right pointer.
      </li>
      <li>
        if it askes sum of sub array, contgeous array etc,
        <span class="red b">apply window to </span>solve it .
      </li>
